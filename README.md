Scripts
======

An assortment of scripts I have created and found useful in one way or another.


addkey
-----

Use this nix script to add your key to a remote server via SSH.

```
./addkey/addkey.sh [USERNAME] [SERVER IP]
```

rubygame
--------

One of my first explorations into Ruby from a few years back. A really simple command line game that isn't very fun at all.

```
ruby ./rubygame/game.rb
```

All scripts created by Bryce Kalow, unless otherwise noted.
